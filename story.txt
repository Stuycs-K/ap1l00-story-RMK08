Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no quarters
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on dogs, I thought I would think about 
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the 
cliff and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the stock market; 
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my grandma's house; whenever I find myself involuntarily 
going to the bathroom before coffin dance, and bringing up the rear of every monster truck I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> 
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately jumping into the building, and methodically 
snatching people's purses off—then, I account it high time to get to the bank as soon as I can. 
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all dogs in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the dogs with me.
